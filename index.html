    Many years ago, in the land near the famous ojoko river.<br>
    There lived a certain woman called Egoli who had the powers to commune with the dead and the living.<br>
    The dead, especially dead kings and queens always tried to pass a message across to their subjects through Egoli.<br>
    It so happenad that in a far away land called imaja, there lived a king who was well feared and loved by his people so much that he revered and pampered.<br>
    Whatever king fuga wanted, he was given without delay.<br>
    Everyone was always at his beck and call.<br>
    No king had been treated in the manner that king fuga was treated.<br>
    But the king had a brother who was forever envious of his successes that he planned daily for him to fail.<br>
    one day, zuga, for that was the name of the king's brother, went to see the king in the palace and he saw how the king was well treated warmly by his people as if he were a god.<br>
    Many brought him expensive gift items.<br>
    A merchant brought so many yards of very expensive materiel.<br>

<h3> <i> Marriage of sale </i> </h3>
<p style="background-color: cadetblue;">
    Marrige is the coming together of a man and a womanas husband and wife.<br>
    It takes two to get married and before that, the two of them must agree to spend their lives together in peace and not in pieces,forever and not a period, for better for worse.<br>
    Marriage is another ball game altogether and that is why it is advisable to take a very good time to study your partner before saying 'I DO'.<br>
    Most people jump into Marriage becauese of wealth and not for "love and understanding", which is the only thing that keeps people in happiness.<br>
    Some parents force their children to get married to someone they don't like because of one reason or the other.<br>
